This code utilizes web scraping techniques to extract textual content from random books available on Project Gutenberg. It then employs natural language processing (NLP) with spaCy to process and analyze the text. The extracted information includes the title, author, language, and a significant excerpt from each book. Additionally, it integrates with the Google Books API to fetch the genre of each book based on its title. Finally, the collected data is stored in a JSON file named "books.json".
